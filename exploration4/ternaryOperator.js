//First exercise
var isHero = true;
var character;

if (isHero) {
  character = "Dhuun";
} else {
  character = "Pesky Gnat";
}

//What would the above assignment through if-else blocks look like as a ternary conditional? When you think you've got it right, just hit the enter key. You can also use the up-arrow to bring back your previous entry

character = isHero ? "Dhuun" : "Pesky Gnat";
